chatgpt is nothing but predecting the next number or iteration or word by using tokenization 
Ex-> ME: Hii How are you
     GPT: Hii How are you , "I
     GPT: Hii How are you , "I am
     GPT: Hii How are you , "I am fine"
     Final output: "I am Fine"

Now, the main question is what is tokenization 
-> Computer only understands the 0,1 language so, every term converted into tokens and gpt takes the token to predict the 
   next token and after predtiction it converts it to actual output ( the way user asked )
-> Hiii - 101
-> How - 201
-> are - 301
-> you - 401
->-> [101, 201,301, 401] - this will go to chatgpt and then it will predict the next tokens of "I am fine" and it will give the answer one by one
     Now, just assume , I - 111, am - 222, fine - 333 has these tokens
-> GPT: 101, 201 301 401 " 111
-> GPT: 101, 201 301 401 " 111 222
-> GPT: 101, 201 301 401 " 111 222 333
and then it'll get converted to the actual output for better readibility

     "It can generate the new data by predicting the next pattern"
everytime you ask the same question it'll give uh different answer , lemme tell you how
->For ex: 1 2 4 what will be the next term????
most of you guys will say 8 and some will say 7 
-> 1 2 4 7
-> 1 2 4 8 
both are correct , It's just a way to prediction and recognizing the pattern
